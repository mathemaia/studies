These are all of my coding studies separated by directories of programming languages.
All of the codes has a description of the problem at the top and comments to orgnize the visualization of the logic structure.

# BeeCrowd
Also Java and Python dir have a dir called BeeCrowd, that contains secssions of programming problems solved with their solution and description on top. All of the files are named according to the number of excercise on beecrowd.com.br, so to check the veracity you have to copy the script and paste it in the excercise page opened after select the programing language said.
* In Java it's necessary to change the name of the class to Main.

# GrupoDeAlgoritmos
If you find a dir called "GrupoDeAlgoritmo" inside this section, it means that you'll find solved problems proposed by the Grupo de Algoritmos, a club of students I'm in, of PUCRS - Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, that is focused to solve algorithms problemns and challenge.
