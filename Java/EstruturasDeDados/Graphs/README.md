# Description of all methods

* **numVertices()**: Returns the number of vertices of the graph.
* **vertices()**: Returns an iteration of all the vertices of the graph.
* **numEdges()**: Returns the number of edges of the graph.
* **edges()**: Returns an iteration of all the edges of the graph.
* **getEdge(u, v)**: Returns the edge from vertex u to vertex v, if one exists; otherwise return null. For an undirected graph, there is no difference between getEdge(u, v) and getEdge(v, u).
* **endVertices(e)**: Returns an array containing the two endpoint vertices of edge e. If the graph is directed, the first vertex is the origin and the second is the destination.
* **opposite(v, e)**: For edge e incident to vertex v, returns the other vertex of the edge; an error occurs if e is not incident to v.
* **outDegree(v)**: Returns the number of outgoing edges from vertex v.
* **inDegree(v)**: Returns the number of incoming edges to vertex v. For an undirected graph, this returns the same value as does outDegree(v).
* **outgoingEdges(v)**: Returns an iteration of all outgoing edges from vertex v.
* **incomingEdges(v)**: Returns an iteration of all incoming edges to vertex v. For an undirected graph, this returns the same collection as does outgoingEdges(v).
* **insertVertex(x)**: Creates and returns a new Vertex storing element x.
* **insertEdge(u, v, x)**: Creates and returns a new Edge from vertex u to vertex v, storing element x; an error occurs if there already exists an edge from u to v.
* **removeVertex(v)**: Removes vertex v and all its incident edges from the graph.
* **removeEdge(e)**: Removes edge e from the graph
